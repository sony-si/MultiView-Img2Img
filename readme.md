## [Multi-View Image-to-Image Translation Supervised by 3D Pose](./readme.md)


We address the task of multi-view image-to-image translation for person image generation. The goal is to synthesize photo-realistic multi-view images with pose-consistency across all views. Our proposed end-to-end framework is based on a joint learning of multiple unpaired image-to-image translation models, one per camera view-point. The joint learning is imposed by constraints on the shared 3D human pose in order to encourage the 2D pose projections in all views to be consistent. Experimental results on the CMU-Panoptic dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the suggested framework in generating photo-realistic images of persons with new poses that are more consistent across all views in comparison to a standard Image-to-Image baseline.
